# Claude Knowledge Transfer - Quick Start

## Available Commands

Run these commands in Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Save context before compaction (now safe even at ~96% capacity!)
/project:initiate-knowledge-transfer

# 2. After compaction, restore context  
/project:retrieve-knowledge-transfer

# 3. Verify context was restored correctly
/project:check-context
```

### 🚀 New Parallel Sub-Agent Approach

The knowledge transfer command now uses a revolutionary parallel approach that:
- Uses only 2-4% of your context (vs 15-20% previously)
- Allows safe execution even at 96% capacity
- Generates all 6 files simultaneously
- Prevents context pollution completely

## How It Works

When you run `/project:initiate-knowledge-transfer`, it creates a `.claude-knowledge/` directory with these 6 files:

- 📄 `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Main project context and state
- 📊 `ARCHITECTURE.mermaid` - Visual system architecture  
- 📋 `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Task completion tracking
- 📝 `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation steps
- 🔍 `INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` - Research results and findings
- 👀 `REVIEW_FEEDBACK.md` - Code review and optimization notes

## Template System

Templates are stored in `.claude/templates/claude-knowledge-transfer/` (installed by this package).

To customize templates for your project, you can edit them directly in `.claude/templates/claude-knowledge-transfer/`.

## Best Practices

1. **Save Later**: With parallel approach, you can safely wait until ~96% capacity
2. **Commit Knowledge**: Include `.claude-knowledge/` in git commits
3. **Team Consistency**: Customize templates for your project's needs
4. **Regular Verification**: Use check-context to ensure continuity
5. **Trust the Process**: Sub-agents write files without polluting your context
