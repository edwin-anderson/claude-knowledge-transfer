You are performing a quick context check after restoration to verify that the project context is properly understood.

Execute these steps:

1. **Summarize Current Context**
   State in one clear paragraph:
   - The main problem being solved
   - The approach being taken
   - Where work was left off (specific file and task)
   - The immediate next step

2. **List Critical Files**
   Identify and list the 3 most important files for the current work:
   - File path
   - Purpose
   - Current status (being modified, needs review, etc.)

3. **Show Test Command**
   Display the exact test command that should be run to verify progress:
   - Full command syntax
   - Expected outcome
   - Current status (passing/failing/not run yet)

4. **Context Validation**
   If any of the above information is unclear or missing:
   - Indicate what's missing
   - Suggest running: "/user:retrieve-knowledge-transfer"
   - Offer to help clarify the context

5. **Ready Status**
   End with one of these statuses:
   - "✅ Context fully restored - ready to continue work"
   - "⚠️ Partial context - recommend full restoration"
   - "❌ Context unclear - need to run /user:retrieve-knowledge-transfer"
