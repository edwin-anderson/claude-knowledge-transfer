# Claude Knowledge Transfer - Quick Start

## Available Commands

Run these commands in Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Save context before compaction (at ~90% capacity)
/project:initiate-knowledge-transfer

# 2. After compaction, restore context  
/project:retrieve-knowledge-transfer

# 3. Verify context was restored correctly
/project:check-context

# 4. Archive important milestones (optional)
/project:archive-knowledge
```

## How It Works

When you run `/project:initiate-knowledge-transfer`, it creates a `.claude-knowledge/` directory with these 6 files:

- 📄 `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Main project context and state
- 📊 `ARCHITECTURE.mermaid` - Visual system architecture  
- 📋 `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Task completion tracking
- 📝 `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation steps
- 🔍 `INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md` - Research results and findings
- 👀 `REVIEW_FEEDBACK.md` - Code review and optimization notes

## Template System

Templates are stored in `.claude/templates/claude-knowledge-transfer/` (installed by this package).

To customize templates for your project, you can edit them directly in `.claude/templates/claude-knowledge-transfer/`.

## Best Practices

1. **Save Early**: Run knowledge transfer at ~90% capacity, not 95%
2. **Commit Knowledge**: Include `.claude-knowledge/` in git commits
3. **Team Consistency**: Customize templates for your project's needs
4. **Regular Verification**: Use check-context to ensure continuity
